#Lit-element-router

This is work in progress... seriously - don't use this yet... 

Inspiration and lots of snippets used from Preact-router - https://github.com/developit/preact-router


#Wishlist
- statiske 
- dynamiske paths
- route - (import {route} from './lit-element-router.js' og så route('/about');
- active på links
- ability to listen for route-changes
- only handle routeable urls...
- automatically hijack local a-tags
- also route if anybody else changes history (listen for pop)
- more than one router?
- dont init all pages up front...
- a catch-all route (for 404 or generic)
- some reusing? - at least when same route + same params
